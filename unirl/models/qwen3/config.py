"""Construction config for the typed Qwen3 AR pipeline.

Sibling of :class:`unirl.models.qwen_image.QwenImagePipelineConfig`
and :class:`unirl.models.hunyuan_image3.HunyuanImage3PipelineConfig`.
Carries weights+precision knobs only; LoRA injection, FSDP wrapping,
gradient checkpointing, and offload control all live in
``cfg.training.policies`` (``LoRAPolicy`` / ``FSDPPolicy``) — the bundle
is weights+params only.

Qwen3 is a pure causal LM (no diffusion / VAE / scheduler), so there is
no ``shift`` / ``vae_dtype`` / ``text_encoder_*`` / ``dynamic_shift_*``
field — the hosting engine's :func:`ensure_req_sigmas` is a no-op for
AR-only pipelines because :class:`Qwen3Pipeline.generate` never reads
``req.sigmas``.
